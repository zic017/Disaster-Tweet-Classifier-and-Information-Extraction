# Disaster Tweet Classifier and Information Extraction

This project consists of three main parts aimed at analyzing and visualizing disaster-related tweets. 
The project was placed as a semi-finalist in the [Viterbi/Greif Sustainability Innovation Challenge](https://www.worldlabs.org/opportunity/viterbi-greif-innovation-challenge) and advanced into the [Min Family Engineering Social Entrepreneurship Challenge](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/min/) at USC
